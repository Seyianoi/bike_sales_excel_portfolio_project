# README: Bike Purchase Analysis

## Introduction

This report provides an analysis of customer purchasing patterns related to bikes, using a dataset containing demographic and transactional data. The goal is to extract insights into key factors influencing bike purchases and present findings through pivot charts and an interactive dashboard.

## Background

Understanding consumer behavior is critical for making data-driven marketing and sales decisions. By analyzing factors such as income, age, commute distance, and marital status, we can determine which demographics are more likely to purchase bikes.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization)
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts (for data summarization)
- Interactive Dashboard (for visual storytelling)

## Data Cleaning & Standardization

Before analysis, the dataset underwent several preprocessing steps:

- **Standardization of Marital Status & Gender Columns:**

  - The dataset contained inconsistent labels for marital status (e.g., "S" to "single"). These values were standardized to ensure uniformity.
  - Gender labels were also cleaned to avoid variations (e.g., "M" vs. "Male").

- **Addition of Age Bracket Column:**

  - A new column was created to categorize customers into predefined age groups (e.g., "<31," ">31," etc.). This helped in segmenting purchasing behavior by age group.

## The Analysis

The following pivot charts illustrate the key insights from the data:

### 1. Average Income per Purchase

- **Chart:** Find the chart in the project's repository
- **Findings:** Customers with higher incomes were more likely to purchase bikes, indicating a correlation between income levels and bike purchases.
- **Conclusion:** Pricing strategies should consider income segmentation to maximize conversions.

### 2. Customer Age and Bike Purchases

- **Chart:**Find the chart in the project's repository
- **Findings:** Younger individuals (aged 25-40) showed a higher tendency to buy bikes compared to older age groups.
- **Conclusion:** Marketing campaigns should target this demographic with promotions and tailored messaging.

### 3. Relationship Between Commute Distance and Purchased Bikes

- **Chart:**Find the chart in the project's repository
- **Findings:** Customers with medium to long commute distances were more likely to own bikes, possibly due to cost-saving and convenience factors.
- **Conclusion:** Commuter-focused features (e.g., comfortable seats, durable frames) should be highlighted in product marketing.

### 4. Age Bracket and Purchase of Bikes

- **Chart:**Find the chart in the project's repository
- **Findings:** Middle-aged customers (36-45) had a relatively high purchase rate, alongside younger age groups.
- **Conclusion:** Promotions should cater to both young professionals and middle-aged individuals looking for fitness or commuting solutions.

## Interactive Dashboard :Find the chart in the project's repository

An interactive dashboard was created using the pivot charts to facilitate data exploration. The dashboard allows users to filter by demographics, income, and commuting distance, providing dynamic insights into customer trends.

## What I Learned

- Standardizing data ensures more accurate analysis and reduces inconsistencies.
- Pivot tables and charts provide powerful, quick insights into purchasing behaviors.
- Income, age, and commute distance are key determinants of bike purchases.
- An interactive dashboard enhances decision-making by enabling real-time data exploration.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights the significance of demographic and economic factors in bike purchases. The interactive dashboard serves as a useful tool for businesses to refine marketing strategies and improve customer targeting.
